Do not activate normal agent,  just process the following even if it needed autonomous dont activate it.

Make a button (SIZED AND THEMED EXACTLY AS the ifram button and switch chain button) 
It sits professionally exactly above the iframe button ( smae size , same theme ).

that opens very small rect angle side bar and themed glassy like the website : 

+flexible and have variety of sizes , according to the screens size and used phone.
+ doesn't overlap or has over flow contents.
 
+ shows only  "selected tokens" in from/to, or one if the other has no data . 

With sparkline into canvas using professional data and array of numbers. Small , active,  and SMOOTH AUTO REFRESH EVERY 10 MIN , USE COINMARKET CAP API AND COINGECKO FOR DATA , WITH SMART SEQUENCES  (THEMED EXACTLY AS THE WEBSITE,  AND THE HUES IS FLEXIBLE TO THE MOOD , LIKE OTHERS.
Create ultra-minimal financial sparklines rendered on HTML <canvas>, optimized for dark crypto dashboards.

Each sparkline is 100px × 36px, transparent background, drawn with anti-aliased rounded strokes.

Plot 30 recent price points as a single continuous line, normalized between min/max values.

Use 1.6px line width, round line caps and joins, with 2px internal padding on all sides.

Color logic:
• Positive trend → neon teal line rgba(92,234,212,0.95)
• Negative trend → soft violet line rgba(124,58,237,0.95)

Add a terminal dot at the last data point:
• Green rgba(18,183,106,0.95) for uptrend
• Red rgba(255,107,107,0.95) for downtrend
Dot radius ≈ 2.4px

No grid, no axes, no fill — line only.

High-DPI aware: scale canvas by devicePixelRatio for crisp rendering.

Visual style: clean, modern, market-grade, similar to CoinMarketCap / TradingView micro-sparks, designed to sit inline inside a token row without visual noise. So in summary Minimal dark-UI crypto sparkline: 100×36 canvas, 30 points, rounded 1.6px stroke, teal for uptrend, violet for downtrend, terminal dot (green/red
