Quick direct fixes, do it before you consume 70% of my (free agent credits  )

Check the backend server api , its really protecting our all secrets including (VITE_ETH_POL_API)

+ Remove ticker normalization (from/to) inputs
Make a new normalization, that waiting for user to choose token,  if not and blurr, then normalize the ticker to the current one NOT DEFAULTS. (So it is always shows accurate ticker refer selected token ) , 

+make the ticker input and the icon in the same small chip connected: LIKE UNISWAP ui,  to avoid mismatchings between the input text and the ticker.

+In (eth) mode , the defaults are not accurate , the prices not showing accuratly , make sure it clean from bugs , and we use the right contract address for the defaults.

+In (BRG) there should not be DEFAULTS optimization,  keep what ever user choosed , and dont change them when he get into (BRG) mode.

+ I added 3 secrets: "VITE_ETH_POL_API" , "VITE_POL_RPC_URL" , "VITE_ETH_RPC_URL)
Use "pol/eth" RPCs , as your primary rpc source , remove old defaults. 
Use "eth/pol" api it works for both chains 
+ Add my new 3 secrets to our server api backend , and be 100% sure they are protected from the fronend exposure. 



+The swap/bridging is too slow or not working, Run log and make sure if you needed (ethereum/Polygon) API use (VITE_ETH_POL_API)  works for both chains.
Check if provider arguments and all needed aruguments are provided 



+++++++ MUST DO TASKS:
SWAP AND BRIDGING IS WORKING 100%. With smart quick time windows ,qouts fallback algos.
If you didn't find a qouts match the costumed slippage, show the other qout but then warn user , frendly, before continuing.


0x returns **everything needed to execute the swap**:
 
 
- `to` (contract address)
 
- `data` (calldata)
 
- `value`
 
- `gas`
 
- `gasPrice`
 
- `buyAmount / sellAmount`
 

 
📌 This means:
 
 
- You **do NOT calculate gwei**
 
- You **do NOT estimate gas**
 
- You **do NOT build calldata**
 

 
You just:
 `wallet.sendTransaction(quote) `
  
### ✅ LI.FI
 
LI.FI goes even further:
 
 
- Full step-by-step execution plan
 
- Gas estimates per step
 
- Bridge fees
 
- Slippage included
 
- Final expected output
 

 
📌 You **do NOT calculate anything** You just follow their execution steps.
  

  
# BUT you need gas & gwei data?
 
Only in **these cases** 👇
 
### ❌ Case A: You want to compare quotes properly
 
Different providers assume:
 
 
- different gas prices
 
- different gas usage
 

 
So you must normalize them.
 
Example:
 `netOutput = amountOut - (gas * gasPrice) ` 
You don’t *calculate* gas — you **convert it to USD**.
  
### ❌ Case B: price accuracy UI
 
If you show:
 
 
- “You will receive $123.45”
 
- “Total cost: $1.23 gas”
 

 
You must:
 
 
- fetch ETH/MATIC price
 
- convert gas → USD
 

 
But still: ❌ No gwei calculation ✅ Just multiplication

 
- Call providers API

-bring fast and best qoute
 
- Display returned quote
 
- Let user sign transaction
 

 
That’s it.
  
⚠️ Strongly recommended 
You should:
 
 
1. Normalize gas cost (USD)
 
2. Compare net output
 
3. Handle slippage & expiry
 
4. Handle revert errors
 

  
## Example: how simple it really is
 
### 0x quote → execution
 `const quote = await fetch(quoteUrl).then(r => r.json())  await signer.sendTransaction({   to: quote.to,   data: quote.data,   value: quote.value,   gasLimit: quote.gas,   gasPrice: quote.gasPrice }) ` 
👉 No math. No routing. No gwei logic.
  
 
- **same-chain in (ETH/POL/BRG) moodes→ 0x vs Lifi
 
- **cross-chain in (BRG) → LI.FI only**

 
Let’s break this properly.
 
- Decision is already made by chain logic
 

 
 (RECOMMENDED): multiple quotes from the SAME provider
 
Why this matters: SOMETIMES USER CHOOSE A SLIPPAGE DOESN'T HAVE A QOUTS RIGHT NOW
 
### Example
 
 
- 0x quote with slippage 0.5%
 
- 0x quote with slippage 1%
 
- 0x quote with different gas assumptions
 

 
You compare:
 `netOutput = amountOut - gasCost ` 
Same provider, different parameters.
 

Then finally you compare :

 provider vs provider smartlly and very fast
