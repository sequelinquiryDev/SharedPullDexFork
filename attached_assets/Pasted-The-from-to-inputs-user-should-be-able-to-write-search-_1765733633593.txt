The from,to inputs, user should be able to write ,search and choose new token through these felds, exactly as the main search bar 

Suggestions lists in (from,to)&(main search bar) should filter tokens,  according to the (switch chain button) if its eth , all searches filter eth tokens, and if it it was pol then all suggestions should be filtered to show only Polygon chain tokens, with high accuracy 

I add new secret,  (VITE_CMC_API_KEY) use it. as the second primary source for prices and 24h%moves . With coingecko alongside,  switching between them every 2 minutes.  To reduce overall calls in one source. You can use the following links to make us reliable source.

Make sure that the website in both (conditions) pol or eth that
you can get reliable sources for loading tokens,  filters them according to the website condition, and you have multiple sources to fetch icons/logos of the token .
