I dont want autonomous mode , is bad , BECAUSE EVERYTHING WELL ESTABLISHED,  YOU WILL JUST CHEAK FOR 
1/ERRORS
2/BUGS
3/SCALABLE TO TENS OF SOTHANDS USERS SEARCHING FOR DIFFERENT TOKENS 
4/ON CHAIN PRICING SHOULD BE 100% ACCURATE AND 100% FAST TO FETCH ALL 1K PRICES AND CACHE

professionally DO THE FOLLOWING "ONE BY ONE" so I confirm to you to proceed to the next one, BUT YO SHOULD FOLLOW THIS CONDITIONS BEFOR YOU START:
+EVERY THING WE LIKE "BACKEND API &WEBSOKET" WILL BE DEPLOYEDIN CLOUDFLARE
+ deal with all tokens by contract address,  real onchain decimals,  and CHAIN ID , because we have two chains.
+dont use external api or open source as a fallback price.

+This is list of orders START WITH ORDER (1), "read only'' REMAINING and then we will do one by one.

1/GET A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT and  PREPARE, AND THEN SAY YOU ARE READY FOR THE NEXT ORDER
+MAKE LOCAL MEMORY CONTAINS A "COPY" OF THESE ORDERS WITH GUIDELINES FOR YOU. SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP 

2/REMOVE ANY PRICES EXTERNAL FALLBACK ALSO OPEN SOURCE FALLBACK , BUT KEEP SWAP/BRIDGING INTACT.
+ ALSO REMOVE ALL "PRICE" CACHING LOGICS IN THE BOTH SIDES "CLINT&SERVER".
KEEP ICONS FALLBACK INTACT.
+DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT 500 BIGGEST MC FROM COINGECKO IN POLYGON.
+AND DOWNLOAD 500 BIGGEST MC FROM COINGECKO IN ETHEREUM, CREATE A LOCAL HOST FILE .JSON FROM THESES 1K TOKENS IN "POL&ETH"
+REMOVE ALL "OTHER" LOCAL HOST TOKENS FILES AND ANY OTHER SOURCES, BUT KEEP SEARCHING BY CONTRACT ADDRESS FALLBACKS INTACT.

3/CREAT OUR OWN ONCHAIN PRICE FETCHER , USING MY SECRETS IF NEEDED IT CONTAINS ALL APIS AND RPCS NEEDED.
+THE PRICE FETCHING USE UNISWAPV2,SUSHI AND "QUICK SWAP IF AVAILABLE" 
+IT SHOULD NOT ASSUME DECIMALS, IT GET THE REAL DATA DECIMALS
+IT SHOULD NOT GET CONFUSED BY CHAIN OF THE TOKEN , BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH TWO CHAINS"POL&ETH"
+IT SHOULD NOT GET CONFUSED BY EXPECTING THE POOL TOKEN/USDTORUSDC, WHILE ACTUALLY IT IS USDT/TOKEN.
+IT SHOULD FETCH FROM ALL POOLS AVAILABLE FOR AT THE SAME TIME, AND CACHE THE" BEST PRICE,MC,VOLUME" IN THE SERVER FOR 20 SEC. 
+DEAL AND MAKE PROFESSIONAL ALGOS EXECUTION TO FETCH THE PRICE OF ALL 1K TOKENS IN THE 20 SECONDS , 500 IN 10 SEC AND 500 IN 10 SEC , CACHE BOTH FOR 20SEC , AND CLEAR OLD CACHED PRICES FOR THE SAME TOKEN , TO AVOID CONTAMINATION.
+MAKE A PROFESSIONAL LIKE BIG AGGREGATOR FAST AND SUPER SCALABLE PRICE AGGREGATION.

4/ USER WHEN SEARCH SUGGESTIONS FETCHED FROM OUR NEW FILE 1K, THE PRICE REQUESTS IMEADIETLY IF THE TOKEN SHOWS IN THE SUGGESTIONS,  SO THE DROPDOWN SUGGESTIONS CAN DETECT WHICH TOKENS USERS SEES IN THE SUGGESTIONS NOW , AND THE REQUESTS ONE REQUEST TO THE SERVER CACHING TO BRING DATA OF PRICE AND MC AND VOLUME,  SO USERS ALWAYS SEES RECENT CACHED
+THE REQUEST FOR EACH TOKEN IS ONE TIME , AND OTHERS USERS ARE CONNECTED BY WEBSOKET WITH THE FIR USER REQUESTED. 
SO WE CAN REDUCE 90%OF RPC CALLS
+USERS WHO ARE SUBSCRIBED TO A TOKEN PRICE GET PRICE REFRESHED EVERY 8 SEC.

+THE TOKEN SHOULD SHOW THE SAME PRICE IN "FROM/TO & MINI RADAR & IN THE SUGGESTIONS "
FOR ALL CONNECTED USERS

USER GET UNSUBSCRIBE AS SOON AS HE "CHANGED THE SELECTED FOR WEBSOKET SUBSCRIPE TOKEN IN FROM/TO INPUTS, OR THE TOKEN NOT SHOWING IN MORE IN THE SUGGESTIONS LISTS FOR 5MIN 
+IN OTHER WORDS IF USER SEARCHED FOR A TOKEN HE SUBSCRIBED WITH OTHER USERS SO WE STREAM SAME PRICE, IF USER SEARCHED FOR OTHER TOKEN AND THE TOKEN NOT SHOWING IN THE (LIST & FROM/TO INPUTS) FOR 5 MIN THEN THIS USER GET UNSUBSCRIBED.


DEFAULTS SHOULD CONTAIN (POLYGON AND USDT FROM THE SAME .JSON FILE, ETH AND USDT FROM THE .JSON FILE , BRG MODE HAS NO DEFAULTS AND NO CLEARANCE,  WHATEVER USER SELECTED REMAINS

BE SMART

 
USE MY SECRETS APIS ONLY
